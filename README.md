# Why?

We wanted a **_much_ faster** 
and **smarter way** 
of **shortening links**
shared in our 
[**`App`**](https://github.com/dwyl/app).

We figured that making it 
a **standalone link shortener**
with all the **features** 
that **_we_ need**,
would make it more maintainable
and reusable by others.

# What?

**`linky`** is a 
**link shortening**
**micro app** 
(tiny application that does one thing)
that can be **_effortlessly_ deployed**
in _minutes_. 

It has all the features we need
and none of the bloat we will never use.

# Who?

This project is used by us in our 
[**`App`**](https://github.com/dwyl/app)


# _How_?
